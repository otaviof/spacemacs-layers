* Spacemacs Private Layers
 Splitting primary configuration of Spacemacs into private layers.

** Usage
*** Including Private Layers
Clone this repository and configure Spacemacs to look for layers on it:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; If non-nil layers with lazy install support are lazy installed.
;; List of additional paths where to look for configuration layers.
;; Paths must have a trailing slash (i.e. `~/.mycontribs/')
dotspacemacs-configuration-layer-path '("~/.spacemacs-layers")
#+END_SRC

*** Enabling Layers
Using =SPC h SPC= shall find the private layers available, and when including them
on ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ will be loaded during Spacemacs startup or
configuration reload (=SPC f e R=). For instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  (setq-default
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(of-custom-theme
                                       of-keybidings))
 )
#+END_SRC
